# TODO

* Get more languages into movement/highlight/swap specs
    * :help treesitter-parsers
    Blocking:
        * better swap of strings in python files
        * tons of regression testing potential

* Keep cursor in same relative place in node when lateral swapping?
* Can make test-watch only print errors? Quiet up all the green?
* I think highlight should do the whole block
* The tests should check if util.R or util.log were called. Easy spying.
    set up in minimal_init?
