# TODO

* Fix getting stuck at the top of the file
* Fix not being able to recurse into callbacks
* should up/down stay at their same level, jumping to prev/next nodes no matter how distantly related?
* Backing out needs to look for aunties, not straight backing out
* j always goes at least a line down?
